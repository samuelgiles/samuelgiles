### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, I work as a web developer @ [Bellroy](https://bellroy.com/), I live in South West England, I enjoy music, cycling and the outdoors.

I work on a mix of frontend & backend projects both customer and non-customer facing across many languages & frameworks. Most days I can be found using Ruby on Rails to build server-side rendered web applications with sprinklings of interactivity via ES6, Elm, StimulusJS, React or custom elements.

I enjoy applying Clean Architecture techniques with the help of [Sorbet](http://sorbet.org/) to help better drive better architecture in Ruby projects that need to be easy to work with, extensible & maintainable into the future.
